Project Description:

I would like to add my favorite 6 numbers to consider for a Powerball entry 
ticket. The winning ticket will be selected based upon overall popularity.

Application requirements:

Capture the name of the employees entering the number.

The first 5 favorite numbers will need to be in the range of 1 to 69 and 
unique. The 6th favorite number will need to be in the range 
of 1 to 26 and flagged as the 6th Powerball number. Keep count of each 
individual favorite number provided to determine which numbers to use in 
our final winning number. Retrieve the max count of each unique duplicate 
number and use them as the Powerball numbers. Only duplicate entries will 
be used in the selection process and entry selection priority will be based 
on highest max counts. If there is a tie based on the max counts randomly 
select the tied number.

Display all entry names with their corresponding number entries sorted 
lowest to highest.

Individual players may play as multiple times.

Display the final Powerball number based on the requirements above.


To try this game, cd into the powerball directory and run 'python3 powerball.py'.
